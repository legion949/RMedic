**GBM**   
For the GBM subtype classification we use 3 expression subtypes (Classical, Mesenchymal, Proneural) as defined in [Wang Q. et al. 2016](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/08/052076).   
   
**LGG**  
For the LGG subtype classification we use 3 molecular subtypes (IDH mutant with 1p/19q codeletion, IDH mutant without 1p/19q codeletion, IDH wild-type) as defined in [NEJM, 2015](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26061751).            
   
Classification algorithms:       
* The Subtype call generated by **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, is done performing a linear Kernel with 10-fold cross validation, using the `ksvm` function of the [‘kernlab’](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kernlab/kernlab.pdf) package. As training dataset for the GBM we use the TCGA GBM samples described in [Wang Q. et al. 2016](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/08/052076). As training dataset for the LGG we use the TCGA LGG samples described in [NEJM, 2015](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26061751).             
* The **K-nearest neighbor (K-NN)** Subtype calls, are obtained using the `knn3Train` function of the [‘caret’](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/caret.pdf) package, using the subtypes as in the SVM calls.  
* The Subtype call generated  by single sample **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA)**, is done using the `runSsGSEAwithPermutation` function of the [‘ssgsea.GBM.classification’](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/08/052076) package. Not available yet for LGG samples.   

The "3-Way" tab (GBM samples only) generates Subtype calls with the tree methods (SVM, K-NN and ssGSEA) and compare them, giving a "majority vote". In case the three methods give three different outputs for a specific sample, the vote will be assigned arbitrary (by alphabetical order).
