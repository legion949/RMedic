1. Select a dataset.
2. Enter a gene name.
3. Choose one of the histological group, default setting will show all the samples. 
4. Select cutoff:       
  + **Median**: split in two groups by the median   
  + **Lower quartile**: split in two groups, 25% lower expressing vs the rest   
  + **Upper quartile**: split in two groups, 25% higher expressing vs the rest   
  + **High vs low**: split in two groups, 25% lower expressing vs 25% higher expressing   
  

Differential expression analyisis is performed using the `eBayes` and `lmFit` functions of the ['limma'](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html) package.   
Gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analyisis are performed with the ['clusterProfiler'](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html) package.
