To deconvolute gene expression profiles we use Single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA), an extension of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA), that calculates separate enrichment scores for each pairing of a sample and gene
set. Each ssGSEA enrichment score represents the degree to which the genes in a
particular gene set are coordinately up- or down-regulated within a sample. In this
manner ssGSEA projects a single sample’s gene expression profile from the space of
single genes onto the space of gene sets. The benefit
here is that the ssGSEA projection transforms the data to a higher-level (pathways
instead of genes) space representing a more biologically interpretable set of features on
which analytic methods can be applied. (Ref:[*GenePattern*](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/modules/docs/ssGSEAProjection/4)).     

* **ssGSEA**, is performed using the `gsva` function of the [‘gsva’](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.12/bioc/html/GSVA.html) package (method = "ssgsea"). Currently available genes list:
