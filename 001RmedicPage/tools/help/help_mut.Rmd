Mutation data (identified with the MutSig2CV algorithm) are dinamically downloaded from the cBio Portal using the [‘cgdsr’](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cgdsr) package.    
Oncoprints are generated using the `oncoPrint()` function of the [‘complexHeatmap’](https://github.com/jokergoo/ComplexHeatmap) package.
